What is an extension?

-The extension is the last three letters of any file. For a word document for example the extension is .doc.
if you wish to change all files of type .doc to .txt for example, simply enter "doc" without the quotations
in the "Origional file extension" text box and enter "txt" without quotations in the "New file extension" box.

What is a file path?

-The file path is a way for the program to find where on your hard drive the files are stored. To find the file path
open the folder containing the files you want to edit and look for a line near the top of the file explorer that looks
something like this --> C:\Users\john\Desktop\examplefolder 
copy that path and paste it using ctrl + V into the "Path to files" text box

*IMPORTANT* Do NOT use the file path for the file itself. If you paste a file path and it looks something 
like this --> C:\Users\john\Desktop\examplefolder\aFile.ext 
Then you have done it wrong. Notice the .ext extension- ^^^		If the file path has a "dot anything" (.txt, .doc, .mov)
simply delete the file with the extension attatched so;

C:\Users\john\Desktop\examplefolder\aFile.ext  |BECOMES -->|  C:\Users\john\Desktop\examplefolder
